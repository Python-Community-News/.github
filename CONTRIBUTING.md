# Claiming an Issue [Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
Here are the steps to claiming an issue:

## step 1. create an issue [^Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)

Start with an issue # Enter a comment that says something to the effect of "I will work on this" and wait for the  one of the organizers to assigned you the issue.
```
#8 I'll take this issue off your hands
```
This makes it so that more than one person does not work on the same project at the same time (only one pull request will be accepted). 

## step 2 fork the code [^Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
after one of the organizers has  assigned you the issue for the code so that you may freely work on it within your own repository

## step 3 Make the necessary changes [^Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
after you have forked the code you can make whatever changes that need to be made without an orginizer needing to ok every change.

## step 4 Submit a PR [^Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
after the changes have been changed statisfatually you may then submit a PR (pull request). This allows the orginizers to look over the changes either accept them or sugjest new ones.  

# CONGRADUALTIONS [^Back to Top](#Table-of-Contents)
you have submited your first PR (pull request)

(or you now remember how the process works)
